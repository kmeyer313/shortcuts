# expand selection to line - command-l. Selects the full line you're on.

This is a line.
SELECT ME THIS LINE DO IT NOW
Default behavior is to remove the whole line on cut or deletion
YOU CAN ALSO SELECT MULTIPLE
LINES AND THEN USE THE SHORTCUT



========================================================================

???????????????????????????????????????????

# Command-shift-l selects the lines you're on, and adds a cursor on each one
# Sometimes the cursors won't be exactly where you expect

After you use this shortcut,
you'll see a cursor on
all three of these lines


========================================================================
# expand to parentheses, brackets, etc.

Contrl-shift-m from within square bracket, curly braces, and parentheses selects everything within it.

(hey you can select me with one shortcut!)
[and me too!]
{and also me!}
(You can even do (nested parens, etc) by hitting it repeatedly)


# in HTML docs with tags, use command-shift-a for a similar behavior, except with tags.

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Here's</li>
    <li>some</li>
    <li>text!</li>
  </ul>
</div>


========================================================================


# in any program, use command-shift-j to select any items in the current block with the same indentation

  for blah blah blah
    What language
      is this
        Anyway?
      Does it matter?
    It doesn't
  seem to



========================================================================

# expand to scope - Sublime has a notion of the scope of where your cursor is, and using command-shift-spacebar will expand your selection to the current scope. Often duplicates some of the functionality above, but it's worth exploring since it often "does the thing you want to do."

(You can use it in parens)
[You can use it in parens]
