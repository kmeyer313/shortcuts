# ====================================================================


# This next feature is called Goto Anything.
# Use command-p to open up this sweet prompt.

# Then start typing a file name and be amazed.

# You can very quickly navigate files this way.

# putting a : in front of your search will goto a particular line.
# the shortcut for this is control-g.

# putting a # in front of your search will search for specific words.
